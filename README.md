| **Heyy! ＼(＾▽＾)／ I’m Harshika Arya** <br><br> Final-year **Computer Science & Engineering** student at **IIT Jodhpur**. <br><br> I’m a **software developer** who loves building beautiful, functional, and intelligent systems 🌈✨ <br><br> My journey across CS has been super diverse — from creating **3D graphics in Unity**, designing intuitive **UI/UX**, crafting **Flutter + React** frontends, to architecting **backend systems** with **Node.js** and **FastAPI**. <br><br> I’ve worked with a wide range of tech: **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **Neo4j**, cloud platforms like **GCP** & **Azure**, **machine learning**, **LLMs**, and more. <br><br> Also… I’m an artist 🎨 so I naturally gravitate toward having fun with code + creativity 💕 | <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/k8kITi9SAwe9JWbUaH/giphy.gif" width="250" height="270" alt="Pixel Art Animation"> |
